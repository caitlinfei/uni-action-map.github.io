This includes people exercising their rights to grow, distribute, and eat food that is fresh, nutritious, affordable with care for the well-being of the land and the workers. We see the UC Gill Tract Community Farm serving as a model for community-based research and the implementation of collaborative ideas.    Our shared governance structure and programming aim to promote community resilience. We are transmitting knowledge about growing and preparing healthy food to increase the consumption of locally grown produce. We are developing and testing models of equitable and affordable food distribution. We are building relationships with other food justice organizations and providing forums and opportunities for popular education. We make recommendations for food and land policies that encourage the expansion of urban lands under production.    Since our first plantings in 2014, we have grown over 70,000 pounds of organic produce, much of which has been distributed free to organizations serving those in need. Our weekly "pay what you can" farm stand also supports our mission of providing fresh organic food to the community.    We also serve as an education center hosting individuals, school groups, classes, workshops, internships,and corporate volunteer work days to teach people how to grow healthy food. Our Farm also provides opportunities for food system and environmental education which we believe will ultimately encourage healthier living and more self-sufficient communities.<br>Mention Justice: Yes<br>Mitigation Strategy: Trees and Vegetation; Outreach and Education; <br> <br><br>                                             </div>                            </div>`)[0];

Residents who commit to planting and watering the tree for two years can reserve their tree on the website or by mail. The trees are delivered, with planting and watering instructions, between October and March. The program reduces the urban heat island effect by shading paved streets, and it helps residents increase their property values while decreasing their energy bills.<br>Mention Justice: No<br>Mitigation Strategy: Trees and Vegetation; Pavements and Bicycling Space; Water Body; Transportation and Energy;<br> <br> Urban Roots: Urban Roots is a youth development organization that uses food and farming to transform the lives of young people and inspire, engage, and nourish the community.

Our mission is to enable communities to develop sustainably and equitably through land recycling---restoring underutilized sites to productive use. Our particular expertise is remediating and redeveloping environmentally-distressed properties, commonly called "brownfields". The Center for Creative Land Recycling champions communities’ economic growth and promotes environmental justice by assisting municipalities, community groups, tribal organizations, and other entities with brownfield redevelopment. Turning parking lots into affordable housing and old dumps into greenspace are just a few examples of how community entities have transformed their spaces with CCLR’s help. CCLR assists with projects as large as city wide initiatives, and as small as less than an acre in a rural community. CCLR projects help return under-utilized properties into community assets across the country. CCLR empowers cities and their residents alike to create more just, equitable, and resilient places in their neighborhoods. Peruse the CCLR projects below to see how brownfield redevelopment can reshape communities and the challenges they overcame along the way.<br>Mention Justice: Yes<br>Mitigation Strategy: Trees and Vegetation; <br> <br> Friends of Five Creeks: Friends of Five Creeks believes that the health of creeks and watersheds supports the health of urban environments.

Through public and private partnerships Sustain encourages sustainable economic development that creates jobs and revitalizes communities in an environmentally sound manner. We invite you to support our efforts. Organization History and mission Through public and private partnerships Sustain encourages sustainable economic development that creates jobs and revitalizes communities in an environmentally sound manner. Sustain was created in 1996 after its founders led a multi-media communications campaign to inform the public that the Northwest Incinerator in Chicago was emitting 150,000 pounds of lead into the air each year. Ultimately, the incinerator was shut down, and funding was secured to launch Sustain. Over the past eight years Sustain has contributed to many national and regional environmental victories by using strong images, compelling messages and creative campaigns. Since 2000 Sustain has led efforts to build a regional food system in the Midwest. Its Local Organic Initiative and FamilyFarmed.org programs build markets for regional farmers and food processors. Current Programs. FamilyFarmed.org is a program of Sustain that encourages organic farming and new marketing and business opportunities by connecting local farmers with buyers. It helps to build a food system that supports local organic farmers by offering them a roadmap of selling opportunities throughout the Chicago region. Through The New Farmer Development Project, Sustain is currently exploring new ways to link Chicago immigrants with new jobs in farming and other opportunities of the local organic marketplace. Involvement in Public Policy- is constant at Sustain where we continuously work with policy makers to implement recommendations for a local organic food system. The 2006 Organic Harvest report provides updated information for this effort. Also Sustain contributes to the Chicago Food Policy Advisory Council, which works to improve access to quality food for all people in the City of Chicago. Sustain is also working with VOA Planning and Projects for Public Spaces to lead the effort to conceptualize a Public Market for the proposed Riverwalk site in downtown Chicago.<br>Mention Justice: No<br>Mitigation Strategy: Trees and Vegetation; Water Body; <br> <br><br>                                             </div>                            </div>`)[0];

The Network is a project of the award winning, non-profit Orion magazine, and actively supports 1,190 organizations (mostly nonprofits). The Network website is also a fantastic place to find an internship or job with one of these great groups. Network member organizations are recognized in their communities as leaders in the fields of conservation, restoration, education, democracy, justice, health, and economics. They range from large to small, urban to suburban to rural, and represent nearly every U.S. state, and an increasing number of Canadian provinces and Mexican states. The Grassroots Network connects this full diversity of groups involved in today's social and environmental movements, and occasionally engages them in coordinated campaigns on regional, national, and global issues, such as the Earth Charter and the Precautionary Principle. Visitors to the Network can find an index of fascinating organizations working in their regions on issues they support. An Events Calendar and Publications list are useful resources for getting connected, and job seekers can find hundreds of available internships, jobs, apprenticeships, and Americorps positions available with Network members. Network members receive practical benefits such as exposure in our publications (the award-winning Orion magazine) and on our website; use of our popular and effective Internship & Career Service; access to our Events Calendar and Publication & Resource List; and reprint rights for articles appearing in Orion for their own newsletters. Finally, Network members share a common set of values, a desire to link arms, and, when necessary, a willingness to speak with one voice.<br>Mention Justice: Yes<br>Mitigation Strategy: Outreach and Education; <br> <br><br>                                             </div>                            </div>`)[0];

Russian Riverkeeper operates four major programs; Advocate, Educate, Celebrate and Clean River Alliance that do everything from busting polluters to advancing climate focused policies to providing weekly trash pickups for over 200 homeless living on the river banks. Today our long-term goal is focused on regenerating the health of the Russian River by restoring some of the over 80% of river and wetland area that has been lost over the last 100 years to channelization, gravel mining, agricultural and urban development. In doing so, we can recover millions of dollars in ecosystem services such as groundwater recharge, flood protection, pollution sequestration and wildlife habitat that are so critical to making our community and wildlife resilient to the effects of our changing climate.<br>Mention Justice: No<br>Mitigation Strategy: Water Body; Outreach and Education; <br> <br><br>                                             </div>                            </div>`)[0];

We focus our programming on our neighbors in Wyandotte County, Kansas but invite all to the farm. Our programs revolve around Food, Community and Education. We grow organic produce on our 3 acre urban farm and distribute it using a Pay What You Please model and through a 50 member CSA and the use of barter agreements. We provide on-farm agriculture education, job skills training programs and community education through workshops and programming. We invite the community in via our programming that grows backyard gardeners and through community roundtables as well.

At Debs Park, our mission is to inspire people to experience, understand and care for the local natural world by providing nature-based programs designed to engage low-income urban families in the outdoor world, and making environmental issues relevant to their lives. We use environmental education to create diverse new young leaders actively engaged in conservation in northeast Los Angeles.

FLTS's unique approach involves grassroot, community engagement to ensure disadvantaged communities contribute their voice in developing healthy spaces in their neighborhoods. In the last five years, FLTS has worked on healthy living community engagement projects in several low-income, communities of color. The idea comes from looking at neighborhoods that are in need of social and recreational spaces or 'spots'. These 'spots' are necessary for children to play, for adults to engage in health and wellness opportunities and for neighborhoods to grow and thrive.

Students will share what they are learning through reflective blog-posts and form teams across sites with others who are working on similar issues in their internships, such as improving access to healthy food for low-income families, creating urban gardens and farms, food hubs, and local or regional policy.  By comparing what they see and experience across the very different sites, student will gain a deeper understanding of the barriers and opportunities in each problem area of the food system.  The course will run for 9 weeks and students will receive 3 credits.  Each site will produce a final video that shows what students have learned through the summer course, with assistance from Middlebury and its partners.  Each site will be supported by a Teaching Assistant who sets up field trips, accompanies students and helps with any issues encountered in internships.  The course professor will meet with students at each site through the summer, assign readings and hold video-conferenced discussion sessions with each site, and work with issue teams.<br>Mention Justice: Yes<br>Mitigation Strategy: Trees and Vegetation; Cool and Green Roofs; Outreach and Education; <br> <br><br>                                             </div>                            </div>`)[0];

Vision: To grow a thriving local food system where consumers make informed decisions; farmers make a decent living while prioritizing ecological stewardship of the land; and all people – regardless of income – have access to healthy food. We push beyond the immediate demands of hunger relief toward community food security (and hunger prevention) with programming that expands our community’s capacity to feed each other today and into the future.  History: Petaluma Bounty grew out of a 2004 Community Needs Assessment commissioned by the Hub of Petaluma Foundation to determine Petaluma’s greatest unmet community need. It revealed many seniors, low-income families with young children and individuals were struggling to afford adequate nutrition. Research with local emergency food providers and Petaluma residents revealed that the demand for emergency food was growing. The response that emerged was Petaluma Bounty, a multifaceted community food security initiative, launched in 2006 with the Bounty Hunters gleaning program and an initiative to start community gardens.  In 2008, the Bounty Community Farm, an urban educational farm site opened its doors to grow food with community for community. On October 1, 2012 Petaluma Bounty became a program of Petaluma People Services Center (PPSC). PPSC was incorporated on December 2, 1976 and is a 501(c)3 private nonprofit organization. PPSC is dedicated to improving the social and economic health of our community by providing programs that strengthen the dignity and self-sufficiency of the individual.  As a Program of PPSC, Petaluma Bounty’s mission is healthy food for everyone through collaboration, education and promoting self-reliance. We seek to foster a thriving local food system while improving low income families’ access to sustainably grown, local food.<br>Mention Justice: Yes<br>Mitigation Strategy: Trees and Vegetation; Outreach and Education; <br> <br><br>                                             </div>                            </div>`)[0];

Partnering with diverse communities and reducing barriers to this work are core focus areas of the program. Through our collective efforts to revitalize urban landscapes we make our region a healthier place, for ourselves and for wildlife.

The majority of TCWC projects involve restoration of riparian native vegetation on streambanks. We focus these projects on private properties along key wildlife corridors, neighboring green-spaces, and adjacent to existing restoration sites. We also fix fish passage barriers by contracting replacement with a bridge (such as the case with the Stone Bridge Project on Nettle Creek) or working as an advocate (in the case of Boones Ferry Culvert and the Highway 43 Culvert projects). As a watershed council, another key role that we fill is coordination of partnerships, watershed planning, and monitoring. The Council has been actively bringing the community together since 1994 when a small group of concerned citizens joined forces to become stewards of our natural heritage. TCWC worked under the fiscal sponsorship of Southwest Neighborhoods Inc and then the Friends of Tryon Creek until 2014 when we received our own 501(c)(3) status.<br>Mention Justice: No<br>Mitigation Strategy: Trees and Vegetation; Water Body; <br> <br> Urban Nature Partners PDX: Urban Nature Partners PDX empowers youth in underserved areas of Portland through building long term mentoring relationships and providing access to meaningful outdoor experiences.Mentor-youth activities take place in easily accessible outdoor areas in and around Portland, are driven by the interests and abilities of each youth, are relevant to a young person’s culture and background, and sometimes include their family members and peers. We provide basic outdoor gear and resources, information about and transportation to neighborhood natural areas, and adult guidance to remove barriers to lower income youth and families taking advantage of greater Portland’s superlative network of urban greenspaces. The Urban Nature Partners PDX program provides a tiered set of experiences designed to build comfort and belonging, physical and mental well being, outdoor knowledge and competencies, and leadership potential as youth grow. Our foundation is weekly one-on-one mentor-youth outings in neighborhood greenspaces. These are complemented by family inclusive group events offered once or twice monthly that provide more in-depth opportunities to experience natural areas and try new outdoor activities. Beyond their first year, youth are offered scholarships to partner led, nature based camps, and leadership opportunities guided by their interests and strengths.<br>Mention Justice: No<br>Mitigation Strategy: Trees and Vegetation; Outreach and Education; Transportation and Energy;<br> <br> Zenger Farm: Zenger Farm is a 501(c)3 nonprofit working urban farm in Portland, OR that models, promotes, and educates about sustainable food systems, environmental stewardship, community development, and access to good food for all.

The School teaches individuals to create, implement, analyze, and interpret public policy in domestic and international arenas. The Master in Public Affairs (M.P.A.) program trains professionals who are able to deal with complex public policy problems. In this program, students are taught sophisticated analytic techniques, making them adept at management and incisive in analysis. Their preparation also allows them to recognize the wide range of cultural values inherent in public affairs. Each M.P.A. candidate selects a policy field in which to specialize. These four fields are sufficiently broad to accommodate the study objectives of most students. The School's four fields of concentration are: International Relations, International Development, Domestic Policy, Economics and Public Policy. The Master in Public Policy (M.P.P.) program is designed to meet the needs of rising leaders in the public service professions, including government agencies and nonprofit organizations in the U.S. and internationally. This one-year program for mid-career professionals provides rigorous on-campus training in quantitative reasoning and policy analysis, preparing degree candidates to return to their careers and assume leadership positions in an increasingly complex public service environment. A minimum of seven years of public or nonprofit professional work experience is required. The School also offers a small program (typically enrolling 3 to 6 students each year) leading to the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Public Affairs. The Ph.D. program produces sophisticated analysts able to apply research skills to careers in public affairs and to further the state of knowledge about a broad range of policy problems. Their varied career paths include positions in academia, public and private agencies, and research organizations.<br>Mention Justice: No<br>Mitigation Strategy: Outreach and Education; <br> <br><br>                                             </div>                            </div>`)[0];

The Sierra Club is one of a few environmental organizations that take an active role in the political process. We take positions on issues and candidates, and make formal endorsements. We are able to do this because of our status as a 501.c4 organization. Inspired by nature, we work together to protect our communities and the planet. Thanks to the work of many Sierrans past and present, we have a long local history, a good reputation, and considerable influence. Our local staff supports the work of our volunteer member committees and activities. We take a leadership role in some conservation activities, and cooperate with other local environmental organizations in others. We have a vision of a San Diego and Imperial County region where people and organizations are empowered to preserve, protect, and enjoy our beaches, estuaries, urban canyons, watersheds, mountains, and deserts; promote safe and healthy communities; and encourage solutions to environmental problems in and beyond our counties.<br>Mention Justice: Yes<br>Mitigation Strategy: Trees and Vegetation; Water Body; <br> <br><br>                                             </div>                            </div>`)[0];

Vision Audubon New York’s vision is one of fully functional ecosystems and landscapes and healthy, well-managed habitats that support viable populations of birds and other wildlife. Audubon’s vision includes a well-informed and engaged citizenry that actively participates in alleviating threats to birds and their habitats and in finding solutions to environmental challenges in order to enhance the enjoyment of nature and improve the quality of life for all New Yorkers. Audubon New York will continue to be a conservation leader in New York State, promoting sound science and progressive policies, and using education effectively to unite and grow a constituency for nature. Philosophy Audubon New York is connecting people with nature and in turn making historic conservation actions possible. Our strong bi-partisan relationships with government leaders on local, state and national levels are augmented by our strong partnerships with other conservation and educational institutions. Conservation More than one quarter of America’s birds are in trouble or decline. They are vulnerable due to a combination of decreasing populations, restricted ranges, and significant threats. Research shows that bird conservation is primarily a matter of habitat conservation. The cornerstone of all Audubon New York’s conservation efforts is science. Bird surveying, species assessment, grassland bird research, forest biodiversity research, and public outreach and education programs are the key elements driving our conservation priorities within New York State. Audubon New York's science staff is headquartered at the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology which allows them to work closely with leading ornithologists and conservationists. Audubon New York was a pioneer in launching the Audubon IBA program. In 2005 Audubon New York became the first state to release the second edition of “Important Bird Areas of New York – Habitats Worth Protecting." This comprehensive guide identifies 136 IBAs, comprising more than 3.5 million acres of land and water habitat, which provide essential habitat for bird populations. Audubon New York works with partners across the state on sustainable development, clean energy, and other environmental issues that are important to the quality of life for all New Yorkers.   Audubon New York continues to be an active leader on Long Island Sound, including advocacy for continued funding of the Long Island Sound Restoration and Stewardship Act.   On private lands, Audubon is working to educate forest owners, foresters, loggers and builders about preferred stewardship practices favorable to birds and other wildlife. Advocacy Over the past several years, effective advocacy at federal, state and local levels has helped pass legislative measures from increasing the protection of the Great Lakes to banning microbeads in New York, to strategies to deal with invasive species and pesticides. Audubon advocacy has also been critical in securing hundreds of millions of dollars for state conservation programs including priority open space projects. Our federal advocacy increases funds for Long Island Sound, as well as protection of national treasures like the Artic Refuge. Centers Audubon Centers are facilities where people can become engaged in meaningful interactions with local environment. The staff at the Centers provide enjoyable learning experiences for school classes, teachers, families, children and adults. Whether it is an investigation into wetland wildlife, a class in backyard landscaping for birds and wildlife, or a week-long camping experience for a group of children, Audubon Centers provide the quality experiences that connect people with nature.  The New York Centers Network includes seven Centers and staffed sanctuaries operated by Audubon New York, and two Centers operated by Audubon Chapters. Audubon New York’s Centers stretch from Long Island to Buffalo.  The Montezuma Audubon Center, a partnership between Audubon New York and NYS DEC is located in the Montezuma Wetlands Complex north of Cayuga Lake in the town of Savannah. This Center serves not only neighboring urban areas, such as Syracuse, but is also an important site for bird conservation research.  The Constitution Marsh Audubon Center is located on the shores of the Hudson River in the town of Garrison.  Like our Ramshorn-Livingston, Buttercup and Rheinstrom sanctuaries and centers, the Marsh hosts a variety of activities for local school students as well as community members.  Our two largest Centers include our oldest and newest operations. The Theodore Roosevelt Sanctuary and Audubon Center in Oyster Bay was Audubon’s first songbird sanctuary, and the Center serves approximately 100,000 visitors and program participants per year. Our newest and first urban Audubon Center is the Prospect Park Audubon Center, located in the heart of Brooklyn. Only in its second full year of operation, it is a partnership with the Prospect Park Alliance and already serves over 60,000 visitors per year.  Education Education is an important component of Audubon’s effectiveness in creating lasting changes to protect the natural world. Audubon Centers provide educational experiences to people of all ages and backgrounds. Educational opportunities at Centers include Citizen Science projects for people to contribute their research, summer and school vacation programs for children, family activities, canoeing explorations along the Hudson River, and learning about wildlife in one’s own backyard or city park.  Our innovative For The Birds! program provides over 1,000 underserved school children in New York City Schools, and has now expanded to other parts of the state including Long Island. Through the study of birds, students experience hands-on activities based on science and within their local environment. This multi-week program includes visits to the classroom by trained volunteers and staff, field trips to local parks, visits to the classrooms by artists, researchers, and live birds of prey. Plans are underway to expand it to other urban areas in New York State.  Audubon New York’s Centers and Education Network is continually improving and expanding the Audubon programs available across the state. Quality education, along with conservation and advocacy, is key to the ultimate success of Audubon’s mission.<br>Mention Justice: No<br>Mitigation Strategy: Trees and Vegetation; Water Body; Outreach and Education; Transportation and Energy;<br> <br> Capital Roots: Capital Roots is striving to create a more vibrant and equitable food system in New York’s Capital Region.

In an era rocked by climate change and other large-scale disruptions, our cities must be resilient in order to survive and thrive. But what does that mean, exactly? What is known about urban resilience, and what remains to be explored? To help answer those questions, Island Press launched the Urban Resilience Project (URP) in 2015, with support from The Kresge Foundation and The JPB Foundation. We began with a survey of the existing literature on resilience and reached out to a diverse group of organizers, researchers, planners, and other urban change agents. The report Bounce Forward: Urban Resilience in the Era of Climate Change endeavors to capture what we learned during this initial phase of the project.  Since then, URP has worked to imagine and inspire the sustainable, equitable, resilient cities of the future. We bring together thought leaders with a broad range of expertise to generate and cross-pollinate ideas. And we share those ideas in a variety of media—books, articles, podcasts interviews, webinars, and educational coursework.

City-wide adoption of Smart Surfaces can cost-effectively cool cities by ~1 degree Celsius per decade through 2050, stem flooding, improve public health, and save cities money, with the most significant benefits accruing in low-income areas.
